  <center><h4>Here's a little more about us and what we do: </h4></center>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Virginia iGEM is a student-led synthetic biology research program. Anywhere from 10 to 20 students make up the team each year. It is a year-long program that has the following structure:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="#applying">Applying</a></li>
    <li><a href="#biol">BIOL 4700: Synthetic Biology</a></li>
    <li><a href="#summer">Summer research with stipend</a></li>
    <li><a href="#fall">Fall research for credit <i>(optional)</i></a></li>
    <li><a href="#jamboree">Giant Jamboree in October</a></li>
    <li><a href="#recruitment">Recruitment <i>(optional)</i></a></li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>What is Synthetic Biology?</h2>
  <p>Synthetic biology combines engineering design with biological investigation to produce a powerful tool for biotechnological innovation. Synthetic biology moves beyond genetic engineering, introducing a new level of control of biological systems. </p>
  <p>With synthetic biology, you will be able to modify the DNA of organisms and incorporate synthetic genes into their genomes. With the engineering design method, you will have a powerful tool for changing the technological landscape and solving global problems.</p>

  <h4><b>And more!</b></h4>

  <h2><a name="applying"; style="text-decoration:none">1. Applying </a></h2>
  <p><b>We will be releasing an application in late November</b>. This application will be comprised of general questions such as why you want to join iGEM, your personal experiences and skills, and qualifications. After reading through applications, you may be selected for an <b>interview round</b> where you’ll interview with a current iGEM team member. About a week or two after your interview, we’ll let you know if you’ve made it onto the 2019 team! </p>

  <h2><a name="biol"; style="text-decoration:none">2. BIOL 4770</a></h2>
  <p>The first part of iGEM is taking 3 credit class in the Biology department BIOL 4770. A few general asides about the class:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>This course has <b>no prerequisites</b>. Previous biological knowledge is not assumed.</li>
    <li>The class is taught by the iGEM advisor, Keith Kozmiski.</li>
    <li>Taking the course <b>does not obligate</b> you to be a part of Virginia iGEM,</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In this class, you will be learning more about the iGEM competition, synthetic biology, and basic lab techniques.. Most importantly, you will develop a <b>project proposal</b>. At the end of the semester, you will propose your project idea to the class and the team will decide on a project.</p>

  <h2><a name="summer"; style="text-decoration:none">3. Summer research</a></h2>
  <p>Over the summer, the team meets regularly to carry out the project they decided upon in the spring. Summer commitment is about <b>40 hours/week</b>. While it is flexible, and some students elect to take a class or two over the summer, you should expect to make iGEM your main summer priority. While you can work part-time (~20 hours or less/week) or full time (~40 hours per week), those who can commit more of their time will be preferred in selection and be paid a larger stipend.</p>

  <p>Our lab is located in <b>Gilmer 148</b>. More often than not (especially if you are working with the wetlab portion of the project), you will be spending a majority of your time here.</p>

  <h3>Committes</h3>
  <p>This year, we divided work into four committees. </p>
  <h4>Wet Lab</h4>
  <p>Wet Lab consists of lab work and experimentation. Jobs include mini prepping, PCR, gel electrophoresis, construct assembly, measurement, and more. </p>

  <h4>Modeling</h4>
  <p>Modeling consists of the use of computational and mathematical models to gain insights on, guide, and analyze experimentation. Programs you might use to implement these models include MATLAB, Python, C++, and Mathematica. Professor Jason Papin advises the modeling committee each year.</p>

  <h4>Human Practices</h4>
  <p>Human Practices is a diverse field that puts your project in context. This committee works with professionals and experts to develop and improve the project into something more impactful. You’ll look at the societal implications of our project and work to incorporate the community into its development. This committee also handles all the team’s collaborations with other iGEM teams.</p>

  <h4>Wiki</h4>
  <p>As part of the iGEM competition and the Giant Jamboree (see below), and as part of the “open-source” mentality of the iGEM community, every team is required to design and develop a wiki or website to share the results and documentation of their project with the world and promote collaboration with other teams. In order to this, you will need to know or learn some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to edit the website. Here is our team’s website (still under active development): <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:Virginia">http://2018.igem.org/Team:Virginia</a></p>

  <p> To learn more about iGEM and the other various aspects, visit <a href="http://igem.org/Main_Page">http://igem.org/Main_Page</a>. </p>

  <h2><a name="fall"; style="text-decoration:none">4. Fall Research</a></h2>
  <p>During the fall semester, you have the option of <b>taking 0-3 credits of research</b> for the work you do in iGEM. The credit hours you take will depend on the amount of time you are able to commit to the project. However, there will still be a significant amount of work to do in the fall, and you should be able to maintain iGEM as one of your main obligations.</p>

  <p>During this time, you will continue conducting research in wetlab, as well as working on other aspects of the project, including wiki and Human Practices, all the way up to the deadline.</p> 

  <h2><a name="jamboree"; style="text-decoration:none">5. Giant Jamboree</a></h2>
  <p>The team’s work and effort on the project over the summer and the fall culminates in a 5 day conference in <b>Boston, Massachusetts</b> called the Giant Jamboree. Each team presents their project to the rest of the iGEM community as well as the judges of the competition through both a poster and a presentation! At the Giant Jamboree you’ll get to meet other iGEM students from all around the world, network with companies, and learn more about the synthetic biology community. Depending on the strength of the components of your project, your team may even leave with some level of recognition. Team Virginia has been a strong competitor in iGEM the last 10 years, and we aim to remain so in the future. </p>

  <p>The best part? The trip is completely paid for.</p>

  <h2><a name="recruitment"; style="text-decoration:none">6. Recruitment</a></h2>
  <p>You have the opportunity to pick the next year’s team. Advertise and hold interest meetings, read over applications, and hold interviews. Use your experience in iGEM to pick the best team! You can even choose to be a part of Virginia iGEM for a second year!</p>
