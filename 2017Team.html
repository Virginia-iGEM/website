<p>Nitrification is the conversion of ammonia (NH3) into nitrite (NO2-) through hydroxylamine (NH2OH). Our bacterium is a facultative anaerobe that natively performs denitrification, which is a multi-step conversion of nitrates (NO3-) and nitrites (NO2-) into inert nitrogen gas (N2). Not only are ammonia and nitrite/nitrate are dangerous to humans, but they also happen to be the nutrients that fuel the process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication#/media/File:Potomac_green_water.JPG">water eutrophication.</a></p>

<p>Our plan is to transform the genes responsible for nitrification from a nitrifying bacterium, Nitrosomonas europaea, into P. denitrificans. Once this is accomplished, we will perform full-scale characterization of our device and assess its ability to replace the bacterial co-culture living in Wastewater Activated Sludge (WAS) -- the current nutrient removal method at wastewater treatment plants.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
    
<p>As the global population rises and water scarcity becomes an increasingly relevant problem, the need for an efficient, cost-effective process of sewage treatment becomes even more pressing. Wastewater treatment plants currently in use are costly and difficult to maintain. Consequently, our team researched ways to improve treatment plant operations so that they are more efficient, making them cheaper to maintain. Although the wastewater treatment process varies by facility, every facility has three main treatment steps: primary, secondary, and tertiary. The primary step removes solid objects such as twigs or trash from water by passing the water through a screen. In the secondary step, bacteria work to break down organic matter. Finally, in the tertiary step, bacteria remove nitrogen and phosphorus to further purify the water. Excess nutrients remaining in the purified water have disrupted the natural ecosystems into which the water is released. This contamination has proven a big issue in such important waterways as the Chesapeake Bay. After investigating further into wastewater treatment processes, we saw an opportunity to make the tertiary process more manageable and energy efficient.</p>

<p>During the tertiary step of the wastewater treatment process, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are removed by employing an activated sludge process. Activated sludge contains a multi-culture of bacteria that facilitate the nitrification-denitrification process responsible for the removal of ammonia. Some types of bacteria perform a nitrification process while others perform a denitrification process.We specifically examined a co-culture consisting of Nitrosomonas europaea and Paracoccus denitrificans because they are two of the most commonly used species in activated sludge. In this particular co-culture system, maintaining a consistent level of N. europaea is difficult because P. denitrificans, a facultative anaerobe, can outcompete N. europaea in aerobic environments. A fluctuation of the ratio of nitrifiers to denitrifiers results from this competition. Additionally, N. europaea cannot thrive in hypoxic conditions. To ensure the maintenance of N. europaea at optimal levels, treatment plants must expend more energy for aeration.</p>

<p>Our solution is to eliminate the need for a co-culture and unite the functions of nitrification and denitrification in a single chassis. We will express the nitrification pathway from N. europaea in P. denitrificans. This solution will eliminate the competition in a co-culture, simplifying the management of bacteria cultures. This system will be more energy-efficient due to less oxygenation of the water being required.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Our search for organisms that possess the ability to nitrify and denitrify aerobically came up with three species of interest: Paracoccus denitrificans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Nitrosomonas europaea. Among these organisms are the genes for comprehensive denitrification from ammonia and nitrates to nitrogen gas. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a well characterized facultative anaerobe that can reduce nitrates and nitrites during anaerobic respiration. There are BioBricks made using genes from P. aeruginosa and it has been used in multiple iGEM projects (SCU_China; DTU-Denmark; BYU_Provo; NYMU-Taipei). The main drawback to P. aeruginosa is that it cannot reduce nitrates and nitrites under aerobic conditions. Some strains are also known human pathogens making it a potential Risk Group 2 organism (Palmer; U.S. Dept. of Energy). Paracoccus denitrificans is a denitrifying chemolithoautotroph (Harms; U.S. Dept. of Energy). It can survive and multiply in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and is shown to be capable of partial denitrification in aerobic conditions (Baumann; Takaya). Most common molecular biological techniques work on Pc. denitrificans and most broad-range vectors and promoters used in E. coli also work in Pc. denitrificans and it has even been shown to possess minor nitrification capabilities (Crossman et al 1997). Nitrosomonas europaea is an obligate chemolithoautotroph with a strictly aerobic metabolism. It feeds off the oxidation of ammonia to nitrites in a process called nitrification (U.S. Dept. of Energy). It is often found in aerated sewage where there is a high concentration of dissolved nitrogen in the form of ammonia. The genes responsible for nitrification in N. europaea are mostly characterized and available as a BioBrick in the iGEM Parts Registry (DTU-Denmark). N. europaea is an efficient nitrifier, but it cannot survive under anoxic conditions. This presents a challenge for sewage treatment plants when heterotrophic denitrifiers consume oxygen, necessitating continued mixing and aeration of the sewage during tertiary treatment to maintain the N. europaea component.</p>

<p>We have chosen Pc. denitrificans as a prospective chassis because it is a well characterized organism and is amenable to genetic modification. Most importantly, it is an efficient denitrifying bacteria. Sewage treatment plants currently use a multi-strain, multi-step system that employs a mixture of bacteria called sludge, which is known to contain N. europaea, Pc. denitrificans, and P. aeruginosa, to remove dissolved nitrates, nitrites, and ammonia. In current systems, the presence of multiple strains in a single reaction adds the risk that one strain outcompetes others and the reactor breaking down or becoming less efficient (Castillo; Heufelder). The sludge must be moved between two separate chambers in the Modified Bardenpho Process (Heufelder 2017), one being anoxic and the other oxygenated. Alternatively, in Sequential Batch Processing a single chamber is intermittently aerated to sustain both the aerobic and anaerobic microbes present in sludge through fluctuations in the dissolved oxygen content.</p>

<h2>Device Implementation</h2>
<p>Early research suggested that Pc. denitrificans was effective in some sewage treatment designs as a co-culture with N. europaea (Kokufuta; Uemoto). In this design, small amounts of ethanol must be added daily to act as an electron donor so that nitrification reaction can be sustained. Instead, we propose a single-organism sewage treatment system achieved by cloning the entire amo operon from N. europaea to express the nitrification circuit in Pc. denitrificans when under aerobic conditions (Fig. 2, 3). Our initial intent was to tie expression of nitrification genes to dissolved oxygen levels in the sewage. By design, our device would need to increase the expression of nitrification genes in response to increasing oxygen concentrations.</p>

<p>Having a single organism that is capable of both denitrification and nitrification will simplify the maintenance of a bioreactor and increase the efficiency of the wastewater treatment process. Pc. denitrificans is not restricted by the oxygen supply, so it is a superior competitor for space and resources under hypoxic or anoxic conditions when compared with N. europaea, which can only inhabit certain zones where the dissolved oxygen content is high enough. In the previous system, nitrates had to leave N. europaea and be absorbed by Pc. denitrificans before being converted into nitrogen gas (Kokufuta; Uemoto). By confining the nitrites to a single cellular compartment (Fig. 2, 3), they can build up and encounter denitrification enzymes sooner, making the process faster. The oxidative process of nitrification produces reduced electron acceptors sometimes in the form of quinone that can then be used as donors in the reductive denitrification steps. This will negate the need for regular infusions of electron donors.</p>

<h2>Circuit Design</h2>
<p>The finished device will carry the coding sequences for amoABC, HAO, Cc554, and Ccm552 from N. europaea. All ammonia oxidation genes from N. europaea are iGEM BioBricks and make up the composite part BBa_K1067005. The amoABC gene cluster encodes the proteins for ammonia monooxygenase (AMO), a heterotrimeric enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of ammonia into a hydroxylamine intermediate (DTU-Denmark; Arp et al 2002). HAO encodes hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO), which oxidizes hydroxylamine to nitrite. The genes for cytochromes A and X (as annotated in BBa_K1067005) encode for Cc554 and Ccm552, two c-type cytochromes. Cc554 accepts an electron from HAO and donates it to Ccm552, which then donates the electron to quinone or other more terminal electron acceptors. Together, these genes catalyze the conversion of ammonia into nitrites. The denitrification circuit will be placed behind a strong RBS and an Mn-SOD oxygen-inducible promoter (BBa_K258005).</p>

<center><p>Ammonia Oxidation Circuit: Our circuit for ammonia oxidation is mostly derived from BBa_K1067005. RBS sequences and an oxygen-sensitive VHb promoter have been added upstream of the coding sequences (CDS). An additional promoter has been added at the midpoint to minimize the risk of premature RNA polymerase drop-off.</p></center>
